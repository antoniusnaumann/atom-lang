# Tree-sitter Grammar Implementation Status for Atom Language

## Completed Features ✅

### Core Language Constructs
- [x] Basic tokens (identifiers, numbers, strings, operators, punctuation)
- [x] Type declarations (structs, enums, tuples) with visibility modifiers
- [x] Function declarations with parameters, return types, and visibility
- [x] Expressions (literals, operators, function calls, struct access)
- [x] Control flow (match expressions, loop expressions)
- [x] Variable declarations and assignments
- [x] String interpolation and comments

### Advanced Features
- [x] Const parameters for functions and generic types
- [x] Namespaces and import statements (:: operator)
- [x] Comptime evaluation (# prefix)
- [x] Generic types and type parameters
- [x] Variadic types (* and +)
- [x] Sized types (Int(64), Float(32))
- [x] Struct inheritance (..OtherStruct)
- [x] Pattern matching with wildcards
- [x] Test blocks and named tests
- [x] Assignment operators (+=, -=, etc.)
- [x] Binary and unary operators
- [x] Closures and lambda expressions

### Tree-sitter Integration
- [x] Comprehensive test suite with corpus tests
- [x] Parser generation and compilation
- [x] Helix editor highlight rules
- [x] Proper precedence handling and conflict resolution

## Known Limitations ⚠️

### Grammar Ambiguities
- Struct/enum constructors vs function calls: `Type(args)` can be ambiguous without semantic analysis
- Complex nested expressions may have multiple valid parses
- Some edge cases in operator precedence

### Missing Features
- Full comptime evaluation semantics (currently just syntax)
- Runtime library calls (cstdio, cmath namespaces)
- Advanced pattern matching features
- Error handling and recovery

## Test Coverage
- Basic function definitions and calls
- Struct and enum declarations
- Variable declarations and assignments
- Control flow constructs
- Expression parsing
- Import statements
- Generic types
- Pattern matching

## Future Improvements
- Add more comprehensive test cases
- Optimize grammar for better performance
- Add support for additional editor integrations
- Implement incremental parsing optimizations
